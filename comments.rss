					<description>as of today i am not sure which gem to use and which proxy version to use. there is also an issue with SELECT queries - i outlined this on 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2978356/running-complex-queries-with-amazon-sdb-simpledb-aws-sdb-activeresource&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;stack overflow&lt;/a&gt;

if the sdb-proxy needs a specific version of aws-sdb, why not patch or continue the development? i would be happy to hack some patches in, please let me know on stack overflow.</description>

					<description>Thanks for the post.  It seems this works as long as none of the options in the input select are selected (except for the first option).  For some reason if any of my items other than the first are selected then extjs only displays that one selected item in the combo.  

for example if the select tag looks like this:

One
Two


The extjs combo box will only display &quot;Two&quot; and nothing else.  Any ideas?</description>

					<description>Do you have any plans to update this plugin to keep it in sync w/ aws-sdb gem?  I get the same error that @dash got.  I'd really rather not roll back to the old gem version.  It looks like there have been a lot of bug fixes since then.</description>

					<description>Hi, This is nice stuff!
I have a suggestion to enhance the useability even further. 
Include tinyMCE plus to the generated forms so users can style textcolumns.</description>

					<description>@Steve/#3: You can easily render the scaffold into an exististing page element. Say you have a div with &lt;code&gt;id=&quot;ext-scaffold-placeholder&quot; style=&quot;height: 200px&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

Then make the scaffold appear within that div instead of using a viewport:

&lt;code&gt;Ext.onReady(function() {
// ...
var es = new ExtScaffold.MyScaffoldedClass({
applyTo: 'ext-scaffold-placeholder',
// ...
});
});
&lt;/code&gt;</description>

					<description>Slick generator. I'm new to Ext JS and just dabble in RoR. Like everything new, it seems to require a steep learning curve (ExtJS) - but maybe not that bad.

I just wonder why you chose to use a single page layout and viewPort? I'd throw something together today using this if I could figure out how to put together a multiple table system (being able to go to multiple &quot;has many&quot; tables from a view). I experimented trying to put together a viewPort from the ExtJS API pages and put the ExtScaffold object in a tabpanel but all I could get to render was the Title and only on the active panel.

You must have something in mind on how to use this for something else other than a slick single table generator? Realizing that a scaffold is just a starting point, could you outline the approach you would take to move into a multiple table system with many relations?</description>

					<description>@blaise/#51: Well basically, you can't (easily). I am currently working on a &quot;reloaded&quot; version of ext_scaffold that will generate all the javascript explicitly and per resource instead of hiding it in &quot;magic helpers&quot;. It should be more straightforward to enhance the generated scaffold then. (Should be ready within the next couple of weeks, once I get Internet Explorer to cooperate, that is).</description>

					<description>Hi, I love this generator.
But I was wondering how I can config the inline toolbar for New, Edit, Delete...  Per say, i have a model that can only create new items, but only certain users can edit or delete.   Any suggestions?</description>

					<description>Great scaffolding!  In ext_scaffold/templates/controller.rb, you may want to replace the two &quot;_url&quot; references to &quot;_path&quot; so that it'll remain on https if it's deployed to an SSL secured env't.

Thanks again!!</description>

					<description>@baddog/#19: I think you spoke a bit too soon. As Alex and Phillip already pointed out in comment #15 and #18, the newly introduced Rails default of ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json broke the original code as the JSON gets nested one level deeper than the TreeLoader can work with. I have just updated the above model code as Alex suggested, so we are good to go even with Rails 2.1's defaults now.
Regarding a potential deprecation of add_child in acts_as_nested set: That's incorrect information - the whole act_as_nested_set has been moved out of Rails core into a separate plugin, which might be the reason why certain API references list that method as deprecated.

HTH,

					<description>This howto is almost completely our of date.  addChild has been deprecated.  The id returned by the tree control is not an integer, so the rest of the code doesn't work.  Is there an update somewhere that I missed?

					<description>Hi Donald

I have it running riht now on my classic sueezebox and on my boom. The only thing is that the screen is a little bit shorter and the date and time are going out of the screen on the right. Maybe it will be a new release for the boom. Otherwise, I will try to understand the code to have something that works better.</description>

					<description>Just wanted to precise post number 2 : The syntax for the additional options for the helper is the following :

 'incorrect_bill-grid' , :width =&amp;#62; 800, :height =&amp;#62; 400, :page_size =&amp;#62; 15, :force_fit =&amp;#62; true , :stripe_rows =&amp;#62; true, :title =&amp;#62; 'List of incorrect invoices' %&amp;#62;

this shows an example using width, height, page size, force fit, stripe rows and title parameters and extends the original grid created by the plugin to something closer to real life situation.</description>

					<description>I love this plug-in! It's been my 'power off' screen saver from the start.

I would like to replace a Roku Soundbridge Radio with a Squeezebox Boom, but never without the weather plugin. Will the plug-in work with the Boom, given it's smallish display ?

thanks

					<description>Hi Martin,

My family is a great fan of your plugin :-) But Squeezecenter 7.2 is released and I'm sorry to say that 2.1.1 does not work anymore. I tried to change the 'maxVersion' in the install.xml but this did not do the trick :-(

SC says &quot;Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at Plugins/WeatherTime/Plugin.pm line 2099.&quot;

May be a simple thing?

Regards,
Peter</description>

					<description>regarding Rails 2.1 and Category.include_root_in_json:

including the root node in the JSON serialization is a new default for rails (see config/initializers/new_rails_defaults). but that breaks the example, so this default has to be set to false.

i think the cleanest way to do this is adding 
ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = false 
to environment.rb.

					<description>Just thinking a short weather forecast would be useful on my Transporter screen and immediately found your great plugin (and finally even got it running on SqueezeCenter 7.1 after patching the version info in &quot;install.xml ;o). Many Thanks for the nice work!
But I would like to repeat the question of the previous post: Is it possible to make use of the Transporter's 2nd screen (e.g. to display weather info of the following day)? That would really be the finishing touch...
A question is where the english weather description is coming from together with german week days (having german as interface language).

Keep on going,

					<description>I am using this plugin for a while now and I love it. I first used it with my SB3 and now with my Transporter. Is there any way to show the time/date information on the second screen of the transporter while using the first screen for all the weather info?
Keep up the good work and looking forward to a new version where the precipitation change is working again.</description>

					<description>The following tutorial is EXT JS vs CakePHP, but it implements drag and drop -- it will be helpful for most Rubists to read it, because the corresponding Ruby should be relatively easy to figure out.

					<description>Hi Martin,

I asked the wunderground people why the didn't include this, and lo and behold, a nice chap called John added it to the feed as .  

Now - any chance you could mod the code to pick up on this for precipitation?

See the URL for the post in the plugins forum.

Many thanks, Andy.</description>

					<description>WOW. Thanks for this great tutorial.
And as Alex said, that one line is needed to run on Rails2.1.</description>

					<description>Thank you for this tutorial!

I've just started using Ext with Rails and I like it. But I had some stones on my way following this tutorial. Because I've started my last app with the latest 2.1 version of Rails and the output was broken I had to make some research for differences of Rails versions.

You have to insert this code line
&lt;code&gt;
# add to model/category.rb
Category.include_root_in_json = false
&lt;/code&gt;
to run on Rails 2.1.

Or maybe you have a better idea how to use the changed to_json methode?

Thanks

					<description>I ran into a problem with ext_scaffold  and extjs 2.1. I kept getting a blank screen while trying to go through the Post demo where Ext.ux.grid was reported to have no properties. It appears to be a problem with how I installed ext_scaffold, mainly I copied the plugin into my rails project and didn't use script/plugin to do it, so the install.rb wasn't run. This left out some important files like ext_datetime.js and ext_searchfield.js from getting copied into my rails public/ directory. I found a blog post that explained how to fix this here:

					<description>with rails 2.0.991 there is now 4 new default, and one of them is ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = true.  which in turn will break the extjs because now the json isn't formatted right.  just change that to a false and from what I see, it works.

					<description>@42: You're probably right. People tend to overrate the helpers and get frustrated when they discover that sooner or later handcoded JS code is inevitable.</description>

					<description>You should take out the helpers completely. Have your scaffold plugin generate real JS and real tags. Your plugin was what exposed me to the world of JS UI libraries, so I thank you, but figuring out how ExtJS was also extremely difficult thanks to your library because the helpers obfuscated the underlying concept behind this library, which is JSON. Again, however, your plug-in did a lot for me and probably many other Rails developers in introducing them to this concept.</description>

					<description>Had this running on my previous version of SC and loved it, but now that I've upgraded to 7.1 it no longer runs :-(  
Look forward to when it runs on the new SC.  Any likely date for this to occur?  Tried to find a beta, without any luck.
Thanks for this plug in.  It's super-useful and much appreciated!</description>

					<description>Excellent plugin, the most useful function (besides music) of my squeezebox players!

I'm a little bit worried however, about the email that I received yesterday from Weather.com. I'm guessing all users received this.

Does this mean that the software will no longer work by this time next week - I really hope not.</description>

had this idea a while ago too (Mac mini media center) just with my beamer as a display - but with this apple cinema display it looks even more convenient and stylish.

Have too check it out someday, I'll bring the popcorn. ;)

					<description>This is an excellent plugin.  I have been using it for a year and I love it.  Something that could be added is: instead of having to choose between precipitation or wind for the third line, using the left and right arrow on the remote control, we should be able to browse the precipitation, the wind, the atm pressure... I believe this would be easy to include and it would be useful (I cycle a lot and both the wind and the precipitation are very important to me)  Thank you very much.</description>

					<description>Just want to point out that you need to consider calculated fields when generating JSON with error messages (model.to_ext_json(:success =&amp;#62; false)). As for now you can replace 

attributes.each do &amp;#124;field, value&amp;#124;
   if errors = self.errors.on(field)
.....

with

errors.each do &amp;#124;e&amp;#124; 
....

in base.rb

That works for me :)</description>

					<description>@Sergey#35/Carmine#36: There is work in progress to let you specify additional attributes in your model to be included in to_ext_json. Until that is available, you would have to hand-code your data store definition and column model, I'm afraid.</description>

					<description>Hi Martin,
first off thanks again for this useful plugin.

I have a model which has some calculated fields, hence not present in the migration and the table. What happens is that even if I generate manually the grid to display table's records, the &quot;to_ext_json&quot; doesn't pass those calculated fields to the grid.
I poke in the &quot;to_ext_json&quot; code and saw it uses &quot;attributes&quot; to fetch the fields of the model.
Attributes doesn't return also the calculated fields. Is there a way to accomplish this without touching &quot;to_ext_json&quot; code?

Thanks for your help</description>

					<description>Martin, I just tried &quot;Advanced Ext JS Form Controls with Ruby on Rails: ComboBox&quot; example and it works perfect. Now I wanted  to show this new Category.name in the grid and I am kinda lost. Is it possible to do?

					<description>Martin, this plugin is smooth like liquid Amon Tobin on a hot Summer day. I am using some of the other ext_ widgets as well.  Are you open to collaborate on more generators?</description>

					<description>@#13/Vipin: Maybe you could look into using a Ext state provider, i.e.
&lt;code&gt;Ext.state.Manager.setProvider(new Ext.state.CookieProvider());&lt;/code&gt; and make the tree stateful (add &lt;code&gt;stateful:true&lt;/code&gt; to its options). I am not sure if this works out of the box but it should enable you to keep the expansion state between page reloads (if it does not work out of the box, look into tweaking &lt;code&gt;tree.stateEvents&lt;/code&gt;)</description>

					<description>Thank you very much for your tutorial!
Does anybody know how to change the fact that I need a &quot;text&quot;-column in my database? I would like to have a column called &quot;name&quot; to be loaded in order to display a tree's node. I haven't been able to find those config parameters.

Thank you very much in advance,

					<description>@Ian/#31: &lt;code&gt;alias_attribute&lt;/code&gt; just gives you additional getter/setter for your model. It does not instruct Rails to prefer the alias over the native attribute. &lt;code&gt;YourModel.attribute_names&lt;/code&gt; will still list only the native attributes, not the aliased ones.

So, if you want to use your alias in the view, you will also have to code the Ext Datastore definition manually (instead of using the &lt;code&gt;ext_datastore_for :your_model&lt;/code&gt; helper).

Setting width/height to auto seems reasonable. I'll look into it.</description>

					<description>Neat!

One problem though, if I have a model for a legacy DB that uses alias_attribute then it doesn't seem to work in the ColumnModel. That is, if I has &lt;code&gt;alias_attribute 'name', 'CATEGORY_NAME'&lt;/code&gt; in my model I still have to use &lt;code&gt;category[CATEGORY_NAME]&lt;/code&gt; in the view code.

Any ideas?

Also: a suggestion - if no height or width are specified in ext_grid_for it should default to auto, the same as the normal EXTJS widget does (in my opinion, anyway).</description>

					<description>One update I think should be included is to change the leaf() method to the following

&lt;code&gt;
def leaf
  unknown? &amp;#124;&amp;#124; children_count == 0
end
&lt;/code&gt;

I was getting an error when multiple root nodes were in the database with no subchildren assigned yet.  Thus the lft and rgt columns were nil.  children_count() fails in those cases because nil can't subtract.

the &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Acts/NestedSet/InstanceMethods.html#M000668&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;unknown?()&lt;/a&gt; instance method of ActsAsNestedSet allows that method to proceed and not fail.</description>

					<description>Thanks for the plugin, its real cool.
I have also got the same problem as Vipin above had mentioned.
Say I have the tree display on the left side of my page and clicking on each node, I need to display the details of each node on the right side of the page. How do I get the action to work with AJAX?
It would be helpful if you could help me out on this one with a more detailed or descriptive explanation or any tutorials that you have come across that could guide me.
Thanks in advance.</description>

					<description>@Vipin/#4: You should explicitly declare a SelectionModel and attach a listener to i.e. the beforeselect event. You can make your AJAX request from there. You should rename your href attribute as Ext will automatically pick that up as you noticed.</description>

					<description>Don't know how to build task 'migrate'...
I had a look at migration files and they seem ok, except that they have a different sysntax...

I'd write:
      t.column :title, :string
But it looks like
      t.string :title

Needless to say, I get an error while reading from DB... :)
What gives?</description>

					<description>Love your work- thanks heaps...

Any chance you can make this generator &quot;namespace-friendly&quot;?

I've found that the model file needs to be moved up into the models folder and have the namespace removed from it's name, and the migration needs to be edited to remove the namespace from the name of the table. However, even after doing this, the urls generated in the view templates are incorrect and do not include the namespace, consequently when clicking the New and Edit buttons in the index result in a page not found error.</description>

					<description>@Joerg: Nope, there's no code for D&amp;D in the tutorial. Ext.tree does support drag &amp; drop, of course. So hack away and feel free to submit your solution as a follow-up comment.</description>

					<description>I just updated ext_scaffold to&lt;strong&gt; fully support and recommend Ext 2.0.1&lt;/strong&gt; - as the current implementation caused trouble, I replaced the DateTime picker with a new version. Give it a spin and let me know how you like it.</description>

But I'm totally stumped by how to get a &quot;Search&quot; widget to work with the Rails &quot;backend&quot;.  Can anyone post a little sample code showing an extjs &quot;Search&quot; widget that can find certain ActiveRecords?

TIA !!</description>

Thanks for ext_scaffold plugin. I tried out a simple model and it worked fine.

Do you have any association support among forms in the future?

					<description>@Jonathan/#10: You have to tell Ext's JSONReader about your primary key as well. Something like this will do:
&lt;pre&gt;var lead_datastore = new Ext.data.Store({
proxy: new Ext.data.HttpProxy({
url: '/leads?format=ext_json',
method: 'GET'
}),
reader: new Ext.data.JsonReader({
root: 'leads',
id: 'lead_id',
totalProperty: 'results'
},
[ {name: 'id', mapping: 'lead_id'}, {...} ])
});&lt;/pre&gt;
I updated the View helper to pick up the primary key column automatically. So maybe it will work for you out of the box now.</description>

					<description>Hi- I tried the posts example above, and it works really well.  I noticed one weird thing though...  When I create a new post and click save, it goes back to the list view.  For some reason, the posts don't show up again unless I click on one of the columns to sort.  Am I doing something wrong?

Oh-  And this is very cool.  Thanks for putting out there!</description>

					<description>ok, that fix appears to have worked for the pagination issue. Although I am now running into another strangeness...

I am trying to integrate this with a legacy db, The model is a Lead model, but the row id is lead_id instead of the standard AR 'id'. I have the model configured correctly using the set_primary_key &quot;lead_id&quot;, but when it is collected in the grid view, the id field is blank and when I click on a row to edit, I get an error, since it is offering a lead if like 1004 (when the lead_ids are actually up in the 50899 range). s there somewhere I need to set it in ext or in ext_scaffold to use the lead_id field? I tried to define:
&lt;code&gt;
def id
  self.led_id
end
&lt;/code&gt;
in the  lead model, but that didn't help...</description>

After to install in the generate ext_scaffold appears many errors.

					<description>@Alex/#5: The features you are referring to can be coded quite simply using Ext JS but are beyond the scope of the scaffold generator. Ext has a &lt;a title=&quot;Ext JS API reference documentation&quot; href=&quot;http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/docs/&quot;&gt;very complete API reference&lt;/a&gt; and the combo box example you linked to can be incorporated into the new/edit views fairly easy as well. As stated above, it's probably best to look at the JS that gets generated, copy that into your custom views and hand-code from that point on.</description>

					<description>Great work, congratulations.
Some questions.  Exists the way to use combo boxes like to:
http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/form/combos.html
Can be used radio buttons in the forms ?
In your pdf presentacion you write about menus and tabs.  You are going to offer the possibility 
to use tabpanels in the forms?</description>

					<description>How do you set initial pagination? I have a table with 150k records in it and when I tried to use the basic ext generated view, it appeared to try to load all 150k in before it displayed....I had to kill the process, as I didn't want to wait that long... ;-)</description>

					<description>I purposely kept the API simple (heh no pun intended) so as to not presume how people would want to use SDB.  

Creating Item and Domain objects had crossed my mind but I wanted the initial release to just be access to SDB - not trying to do anything fancy on top yet.

More later.... :)

Heh martin - if you have patches then let's have them!  I still have to do the rdoc and more polish.</description>

					<description>@#7/Tom: Good to hear that the generator will be given a thorough test ;-). I just have a couple of things to look at in my &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://rug-b.rubyforge.org/svn/ext_scaffold/TODO&quot;&gt;TODO list&lt;/a&gt; and should be ready to release a first version by the end of next week. If you would like to try out the cell-editing, I would surely love to to integrate your solution. Any contribution is of course most welcome. Then again, you are definitely right stating that a scaffold generator can only provide a starting point and perhaps point out some best pratices on how to proceed.</description>

					<description>I'd like to join the chorus for applauding your work.  Thanks for the great plugin, Martin!

However, I agree with Miguel as well - it would be nice for it to make use of cell-editing capabilities of Editable Grids.  I really want to use this plugin for my new project, so I'll try to modify the generated code to see how easy / difficult it is to achieve it.  

On the other hand, perhaps I shouldn't expect too much from a scaffold generator - there will always be features that are needed to meet a particular business requirement, so it might be better for generators like this to stay simple.

When do you plan to have this as an official Rails plugin?  Are you / will you be looking for contributors as well?</description>

					<description>It worked out of the box for me.
I expected a double-click in the list to give me the edit panel, instead of the show.

I was able to customise the widths of the columns, but was unsure for the best way to pipe in the autoWidth:true to Ext.grid.ColumnModel. It worked when adding it to the helper but not in the index.html.rb

 'recording-grid', :autoWidth =&amp;#62; true %&amp;#62;

This is mostly because I'm a newby to rails and haven't quite grokked how it all fits together.

I also found that some settings I fiddled with stayed set in the browser, so I'm guessing if the user adjusts the column width it gets remembered. This might be confusing for iterative UI design. Resetting the browser doesn't work, you have to quit it.

Nevertheless, I'm excited for the new GUI tools this plugin makes possible - keep up the great work.

					<description>Good job! The looks of the ext grids are great. But imho, their real potential lies in their cell editing capabilities. It seems then odd to edit records via a form.</description>

					<description>@#2/Some guy: The generator will leave existing models alone, so you could potentially generate controllers/views for existing resources but would have to merge the controller code manually.

The helpers will be put into one central file within the plugin before the official release - got that on my refactoring TODO list :-)</description>

					<description>I'd like to see a generator to use existing model and create controllers and views instead of having to do it from scratch.  

The other thing is that the generated helper modules are identical except for the module name - not very dry.</description>

					<description>That's pretty nifty. I recently got a 37&quot; Westinghouse 1080p secondhand from Craigslist for $700USD and use it with my Macbook Pro. Surely the pixels are smaller on the Apple displays, but it's actually about the perfect size for my rather tiny (18sq meters, 200sq feet) apartment

I might try out the Remote Buddy software however for additional control.</description>

					<description>Hi, I love your plugin too but unfornulately it doesn't work on SqueezeCenter 7.0.
So, if you have a little time to drop you plugin into 7.0 ... it could be great.
Like Ken, I do miss seeing the weather forecast on the SB.</description>

					<description>Great plugin. I have used it on Mac and PC without any issues.
The addition I would most like to see is a dual location option... I work in one country and have my home in another, the comparison is always of interest. Fliping between two settings regularly would be great.

Thanks for all the work you have done.

					<description>Very nice plugin!

One request though:
I would love to be able to select the language apart from the Slimserver setting (e.g. Slimserver: English; weather: German).

					<description>@Phil (#60): I don't think the Squeezeboxes' diplay needs actual screen saving. I never heard about any burn in problems with the display.</description>

					<description>&lt;b&gt;Screensaver&lt;/b&gt;

Hi - Love the plugin - thanks

Does the screensaver actually 'save' the screen.  I know that screensavers are for CRTs, and clearly SB doesn't have a CRT.

So, if I leave the screensaver on a brighter setting, will it affect the LEDs?

Thanks Phil</description>

					<description>Actually, that is a great idea. I am using a squeezebox, so the display is not too big. I would love to be able to do away with the time altogether, or at least minimize it, so that the weather information has more room to display.

I don't know anything about programming, so I don't know if this is possible, but it would be nice.

Great plug-in, by the way. Works like a charm!</description>

					<description>Got it working! I was hoping for more settings, where I could set the current temperature to be the dominant item on the left side of the squeezebox. 

Great plug-in.

					<description>Works awsome, no combatibility issues SB/3 and latest server and player software. I was wondering is there a way that the data can be derived from a site called Weather Underground www.wunderground.com. I know they have &quot;Weather Stickers&quot; that can be added to websites. WU has a little more accurate data for my area than Weather Channel.

Thanks for a great plugin....

					<description>Looks great!  One problem: mine is only displaying &quot;Tomorrow Mostly Sunny&quot; and I'm not getting any current info, i.e. &quot;Today Clear&quot; a la your sample screens on this page.  Is there a setting I need to change, or is it just the info I'm getting from weather.com?</description>

					<description>Hi,

nice plugin. 
Since I own a weather station, I would've loved support for e.g. Weather Underground. Then in your weather plugin I should just add my own weather station ID and get the weather data/forecasts etc. directly in my SB3! Now I've been using the too overloaded SuperDateTime plugin to do that, but yours are more suited to what I'm looking for and way nicer (less overloaded wit stuff I don't need)</description>

					<description>Hi, great plugin, can't do without anymore ! Which is also a problem, as I have now updated to 6.5 and the plugin is stuck on &quot;WEATHER FORECAST LOADING&quot; prompt with date and time displayed, but nothing else shows up, i.e. no graphical display and most importantly no weather forecast !

It seems like the text alignment &quot;pushes&quot; the whole display area to the left...any idea ?

Thanks</description>

					<description>Hi,
Slimserver 6.5 is released, - and I'm looking forward to an update for WeatherTime.
It is  a very &quot;nice&quot; plugin, and the new version of Slimserver has to wait for the plugins in use, among them WeatherTime!
Anyone who knows.........?

					<description>This is such a great tool! I updated to the new 2.5 server beta (which works much better than the current version) but unfortunately this essential plug-in does not work with the .5 version. Is there an update planned? Pleeeeeeeeeeeze?</description>

					<description>Great plugin!  I wonder how difficult it would be to use NOAA data.  From what I understand, NOAA doesn't require registration and data can be retreived via FTP.  Actually, this is where weather.com gets a majority of information, then modifies it for it's own purposes.</description>

					<description>Yeah, no problem with UK weather here.  One thing I would like is to see humidity % instead of Precip.</description>

					<description>@Phil (#37): UK forecasts are definitely supported at www.weather.com. I heard though, that this is a somewhat smaller subset of what www.weather.co.uk has to offer - please make sure you find your location codes on the US site -  WeatherTime gets it's data there.</description>

					<description>Thanks for advice about the ID &amp;#38; Key.

					<description>@Evan(#27)/Svenne(#33): I really would love to save you the hassle of registering directly with Weather.Com(R), but the way things are now - I simply can not make WeatherTime compliant with their Terms of Use for the weather data. I tried to come as close as possible, but , to give one example, you simply can not display full color icons on a Squeezebox, not to mention the SliMP3.
So I leave the responsibility of registering and using WeatherTime up to you. The source code of WeatherTime (file: Plugin.pm, line 36ff. as of version 1.7) has a complete list of issues.</description>

					<description>I think you are a little off on the weather.com registration. The way I read it they want you to register for your application and embed your key. This way they can gauge how much traffic is geing generated by your app. I don't think they actually want each user to register.

That said, I love the plugin and am kicking myself for upgrading to a MySQL build. Please release an update that will work in the new builds.</description>

					<description>FYI - In reference to #18 above, I found my problem. I had installed a previous version in the Plugins directory without using the path names. This put everthing in the plugins directory, not in the Weathertime directory.  I believe that this was overriding the new version that I just installed in the correct location.  Now all my problems are gone and this plugin is working great.</description>

					<description>@George (#19/20): Hi George, yes absolutely. You can change the time format in SlimServer's Settings (Formatting) and if that is still not short enough, you can select a shorter date format in WeatherTime's plugin settings (i.e. a date format without the year).</description>

					<description>Awesome little program. I am using 1.6.3 and the date is getting truncated.

For example:
12:59:16 AM - 06/02 (only half of the last 2) is showing

Is it possible not to display the seconds so as to make more room for the rest of the date?</description>

					<description>This is a very nice plugin but I still have two issues. One is that every time that the Slim Server is stopped and re-started, this plug in goes back to a 2 line display with no graphics. If I uncheck the plug-in, click the &quot;change&quot; button, check the plug-in, and click the &quot;change&quot; button again, the graphics come back.

I also don't see any options anywhere to select the shorter date format of &quot;MM/DD&quot;. I don't see it in the plug-in section or in the formatting section.

I am running Slim Server 6.2.2 and version 1.6.3 of the plugin for Windows XP.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</description>

					<description>@#16/Sam Lowry: Thanks for your report. WeatherTime does not provide a complete set of icons at this time, indeed. I just added a note to the Restriction &amp; Known Bugs section to clarify that. Help on this would be appreciated!!! :-)</description>

					<description>Hi-
I love this plugin. Works great. I did have an unusual thing happen last night, I got a ? instead of a graphic icon like usual. I think it was because the forcast was &quot;Windy&quot;. No big deal, it isn't windy that often, but I figured you should know in case you wanted to create a new icon.

					<description>Thank you for this great plugin (with nice sun and clouds, too :-)). I made a couple of changes:

- I added the overlay bell as in DateTime so I can see if the alarm is on;
- I tried to change the update mechanism because the actual one (a timer that calls tictac that calls update()) breaks the Caller ID plugin (http://www.thespicers.net/cid.html): after just one second (instead of 30) the screen returns to the weather page. My way seems to be ok but I don't really know how the update stuff works (my SB has been turned on for the first time yesterday) and I think I might have broken the scrolling system.

If you'd like to take a look, here you can find a patch against the 1.6.3 release. It's very small:

					<description>Looks like a very nice plugin but it is crashing my SlimServer on OSX. Seems to load up fine when the server starts, but as soon as the plugin tries to retrieve the weather forecast the server crashes. I see the following in the slimserver.log:

2006-05-12 22:42:19.9671 SlimServer done init...
Can't use string (&quot;Time::localtime&quot;) as an ARRAY ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in use at (eval 67) line 32.
2006-05-12 22:44:20.9088 Got to the END.
2006-05-12 22:44:20.9090 Got sigint.
2006-05-12 22:44:20.9091 SlimServer cleaning up.

Any ideas? Is this an OSX peculiarity? I have Perl 5.8.6 (darwin)</description>

					<description>1.6.1 with slimserver 6.5b1 - 7264 - Linux (May 2nd nightly) crashes with the following when I try to use &quot;MM/dd&quot; format:
Undefined subroutine &amp;#38;Plugins::WeatherTime::Plugin::strftime called at /usr/local/slimserver/Plugins/WeatherTime/Plugin.pm line 2639.

I have to manually edit /etc/slimserver.conf to change the '%m/%d' format to 'std' to successfully start the daemon up again.

(BTW, I wanted to post this on the slimdevices forum, but it appears to be down right now)</description>

					<description>@Kyle (#3/#4): V1.6 now allows to set shorter date formats (such as &quot;MM/DD&quot;) in the plugins's settings. So the truncation problems should be history.</description>

					<description>This is great!  So useful.  And to pick up your point in comment 2 above, YES!  Please please do allow a manual startup option!  The ability to quickly look up weather forecasts for the next few days on the squeezebox without having to temporarily set it up as a screensaver would be so very handy.  So yes, it is definitely a feature request!  :o)</description>

					<description>This is a very cool utility indeed!  

I have one observation, one possible issue, and one feature request :-)

Observation: I also found it a little confusing to know how to start the display, but I don't think there's any need to do it any differently than now, just a little more clarity in instructions about how to configure screen savers.

Possible issue: At one point when I was messing around with settings this evening, the SB got into a state where loud noises were being produced.  Once I turned all three screensavers back to the defaults, the noise stopped, and when I re-enabled weather it resumed working correctly.  I tried several half-hearted attempts at reproducing this, but was not able to.

Feature Request: Why not have a 3-day or 5-day forecast instead of just tomorrow?

Thanks!!!

					<description>Great Plug-in.  It was working great for me with SoftSqueeze but after adding my new SqueezeBox hardware, I don't get a graphical display anymore.  How can I get the nice graphics back again?  Thanks.</description>

					<description>This is so cool!  Any chance in getting the date and time to scroll instead of truncating it?  Due to the wife, I can't use 24hr time.  She likes the little am/pm label which eats up screen space and usually pushes my date off to the right.

If you were able to make it scroll, it would also be nice if we could configure the scroll rates independent to the global ones.  This way, we could make the date scroll slower and less often to make it easier to read (or would it?).</description>

					<description>Great utility.  Thanks!  One comment/question:  How do you start WeatherTime manually?  I don't see that option, I can only see the option to set it as a screensaver. Thanks!</description>
