Good to hear that <a href="http://extjs.com/">Ext JS</a>, the high level Javascript framework for rich GUI development is getting its well-deserved attention.

That also makes my time feel well spent on that <a href="/2008/01/08/ext-js-and-rails-how-do-they-get-along/">talk about Ext JS with Rails on 10th January 2008</a>, I'm currently preparing for the <a href="http://www.rug-b.com/">Berlin Ruby User Group (RUG-B)</a>.
