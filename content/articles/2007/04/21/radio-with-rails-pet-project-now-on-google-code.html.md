A little pet project I have been developing for a while starred in the last couple of issues of the German <a title="Entwickler Magazin" href="http://www.entwickler-magazin.de/">Entwickler-Magazin</a> (~ developer's magazine). It is a Ruby on Rails application called Radio and can record scheduled audio streams from the internet and provide you with a local RSS feed of the recordings in MP3 format. Cool to carry around radio recordings on your iPod ;-)

<a class="imagelink" title="Screenshot Radio English" href="/2007/04/21/radio-with-rails-pet-project-now-on-google-code/radio_screenshot_en.png"><img id="image41" alt="Screenshot Radio English" src="/2007/04/21/radio-with-rails-pet-project-now-on-google-code/radio_screenshot_en_thumbnail.png" /></a>

The source is published under a <a title="GPL License" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt">GPL license</a>, so you can grab <a title="radioonrails project page on Google Code" href="http://code.google.com/p/radioonrails/">radioonrails from Google Code</a> now and do whatever you want with it (almost).
By the way, the GUI is available in German and English and will honor your browsers preferences in that respect.

Feedback is very much appreciated! Just drop me a line at <martin.rehfeld@glnetworks.de>
